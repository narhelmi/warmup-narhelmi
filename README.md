# Warmup

Download the [Wine Quality
dataset](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). Choose the
one that corresponds to your preference in wine.

## Regression

Build a regression model to predict the wine quality. You can choose any model
type you like; the purpose of this exercise is to get you started. Evaluate the
performance of your trained model -- make sure to get an unbiased performance
estimate!

## Classification

Now predict the wine quality as a class, i.e. model the problem as a
classification problem. Evaluate the performance of your trained model again.

## Submission

Upload your code and a brief description of your results.
